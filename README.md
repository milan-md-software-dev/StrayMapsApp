StrayMaps

StrayMaps is an Android application made for the purpose of reporting stray animals and lost pets. The goal of the app is to make it easier for pet-owners to find their lost pets, as well as for people in general to help stray animals. I made the app in Android studio using Jetpack Compose and MVVM architecture, as well as Room, Coil, Firebase authentication, Coil, Dagger Hilt, and Mapbox.
